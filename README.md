## DESIGN AND CONTROL OF A HIGH PRECISION LASER CUTTING MACHINE
  This repository includes all files files related to the reproduction of a high precision laser cutting machine. This machine is the topic of paper IMECE2018-88131 from the ASME 2018 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition, November 9-15, 2018, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

  This repository is divided into three sections: the SolidWorks model, the .STL files used by 3D printers, and the drawings for each of the parts. 

  * To open the SolidWorks model: download the repository, navigate to the 3D Model Files - Solidworks folder, and open the LCOA-1.SLDASM file. For reference, all part numbers are described in the PN file located in the root folder.

  * To open the .STL files: download the repository and navigate to the 3D Printer Files folder.

  * To open the drawing files: download the repository, navigate to the Drawing Files folder, and then to the PDF folder. PDF versions of each drawing is located here.
  
### Please note:
This is an ongoing project. Therefore, although the 3D Printing files (.STL) should be up to date, the most up to date files will be the SolidWorks models. 

  Additionally, although there are drawing files for every part, only pertinent dimensions are given. As stated on every drawing, all dimensions are for reference and part fabrication shall be performed according strictly to the solid models. If any discrepancies occur, the solid model shall be assumed to be correct.
